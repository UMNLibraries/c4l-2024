      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why Minneapolis</h2>
				<p>The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is one of the nation's top public research universities, with an award-winning library system to match. The University of Minnesota Libraries are excited to invite the Code4Lib community back to the midwest, to our hometown, and to our beloved campus. We propose to host this event in the very heart of our school: Coffman Memorial Union.  Come visit the institution that invented the pacemaker, the retractable seat belt, and the Honey Crisp apple. Come meet library colleagues who launched the Data Curation Network, lead the Mapping Prejudice Project, and podcast the History of Transgender Activist Communities. Wherever your professional interests lie, you'll find your warm and dedicated counterparts here at the University of Minnesota.</p>

				<p>The city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota are a welcoming place for everyone. Minneapolis is a vibrant and diverse town known for its parks, lakes, art museums, theater, food, and music venues. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) has been named the "Best Airport in North America" for the second straight year, and the city has great public transportation options. Ride our light rail from the airport directly to your hotel downtown, and immediately curbside to the conference venue on campus.</p>

        <h2>Travel</h2>
				<h3>Getting here</h3>
				<p>Minneapolis is well connected via airlines, trains, and driving.</p>
        <ul>
					<li>Minneapolis-St.Paul International airport (MSP) is a hub for Delta airlines. MSP has 756 arrivals per day, so it’s easy to get to from almost anywhere in the US.  The airport is only 18 minutes by car or 41 minutes by light rail (same station transfer required) from the venue.</li>
					<li>Amtrak’s Empire Builder has daily service from Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle through St. Paul’s Union Depot. Summer 2023 will see the launch of the Great River train from Chicago to St. Paul via Milwaukee, with a second daily round trip potentially starting in Autumn 2023. Union Depot is 30 minutes direct via light rail or 20 minutes by car.</li>
					<li>Minneapolis is served by Interstates 35 and 94, with Interstate 90 approximately 90 minutes south.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Getting around</h3>
				<p>The University’s Minneapolis campus is very well served by <a href="https://metrotransit.org">Metro Transit</a> and <a href="https://pts.umn.edu/transit/transit">campus buses</a>. While large, the conference venue is centrally located and less than 7 minutes’ walk (slightly less than 0.3 miles) from the Graduate Hotel. </p>
