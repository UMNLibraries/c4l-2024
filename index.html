      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why Minneapolis</h2>
				<p>The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is one of the nation's top public research universities, with an award-winning library system to match. The University of Minnesota Libraries are excited to invite the Code4Lib community back to the midwest, to our hometown, and to our beloved campus. We propose to host this event in the very heart of our school: Coffman Memorial Union. Come visit the institution that invented the pacemaker, the retractable seat belt, and the Honeycrisp apple. Come meet library colleagues who launched the Data Curation Network, lead the Mapping Prejudice Project, and host the world's largest transgender oral history archive. Wherever your professional interests lie, you'll find your warm and dedicated counterparts here at the University of Minnesota.</p>

				<p>The city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota are a welcoming place for everyone. Minneapolis is a vibrant and diverse town known for its parks, lakes, art museums, theater, food, and music venues. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) has been named the "Best Airport in North America" for the second straight year, and the city has great public transportation options. Ride our light rail from the airport directly to your hotel downtown, and immediately curbside to the conference venue on campus.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="venue">
        <h2>Venue</h2>
				<p>We plan to host Code4Lib on the University’s Minneapolis East Bank campus. <a href="https://sua.umn.edu/reserve-space/all-spaces/great-hall">Coffman Memorial Union’s Great Hall</a> features ample space for 200 attendees, <a href="https://sua.umn.edu/reserve-space/all-spaces/conference-rooms-cmu">spaces for pre-conference workshops</a>, and conference support. Located at the heart of the Minneapolis campus, Coffman’s facilities, shops, and dining options make it an ideal location for a conference. Likewise, campus has several excellent options for a conference reception: <a href="https://wam.umn.edu/about/rentals/spaces/">the Weisman Art Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.northrop.umn.edu/space-rental">Northrop Auditorium</a>, <a href="https://www.goldengopherfund.com/gopher-sports-spaces/rental-spaces/huntington-bank-stadium/indoor-club-room/index.html">Huntington Bank Stadium</a>, or <a href="https://mac-events.org/rooms/">McNamara Alumni Center</a> offer superior facilities within very short walking distances of the venue and <a href="#hotels">hotels listed below</a>.</p>

				<h3>COVID-19 precautions and medical information</h3>
				<p>As of this writing, the University of Minnesota does not require masks to be worn indoors on campus. However free 3M N95 masks remain available at numerous locations, including several in Coffman and nearby buildings.</p>

				<p>A pharmacy with a large selection of over-the-counter products, campus clinic, and an off-campus CVS Pharmacy are all nearby the venue and many hotels.</p>

				<h3>Sustainability</h3>
				<p>In alignment with the <a href="https://president.umn.edu/mpact-2025">University of Minnesota's MPACT2025 strategic plan</a>, the committee will implement sustainable event best practices where feasible. This may include but is not limited to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>providing a hybrid event, streaming the event online;</li>
					<li>coordinating with Facilities Management to implement <a href="https://facilities.umn.edu/our-services/reuse-recycling-waste/zero-waste-events">Zero Waste event features</a>;</li>
					<li>encouraging on campus lodging, walking, public transit, and nearby activities;</li>
					<li>reducing printing, distributing materials digitally;</li>
					<li>working with caterers for real dinnerware and silverware (preferred) or compostable if necessary, using bulk condiments of possible, and building a plant-friendly menu; and</li>
					<li>requesting attendees bring their own water bottles and providing water from jugs rather than plastic bottles.</li>
				</ul>

                <h3>Scarves</h3>
                <p>Recognizing that March in Minnesota is generally not t-shirt weather, we propose instead purchasing custom scarves for an especially unique and practical Code4Lib memento.</p>
      </section>

				<p>For attendees:</p>
